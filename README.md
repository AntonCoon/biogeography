# biogeography
The project about geography influence on genome of plant.

#### The goal
      ● Determine the climate and soil influence on genome of modeling plants.
      ● Build a model base on genome and environment data.
  
#### Tasks
      ● Get familiar with WorldClim and Soil databases
      ● Download 1001 genome SNPs data and collection coordinates of arabidopsis
      ● Get climate and soil data associated with this points
      ● Convert SNPs to vectors by Admixture tools
      ● Design model
      ● Interpretation of result
